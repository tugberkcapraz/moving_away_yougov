# Moving Away From the City Center: Opinions from Germany. Part 1

This repository contains data and code behind the analysis I shared on medium. 

I made basic visualizations of opinions on moving away from the city centers against key demographics.

### Data



The data is collected by **_Yougov_** and **_Imperial College of London_**. Data made publicly accesible at
[this github repo](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker)
